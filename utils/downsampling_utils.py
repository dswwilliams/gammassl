    Implements class weighted modal downsampling.
        i.e. for a kernel size of N, the value returned for each N x N patch is the mode of the classes in that patch.
        This modal value is also weighted by the class weights, where 'thing' classes are weighted more heavily.
        This means that the mode of the classes in a patch is more likely to be a 'thing' class, than a 'stuff' class.
    This is used to downsample segmentation labels while accounting for class imbalance (many more stuff pixels than thing pixels).
